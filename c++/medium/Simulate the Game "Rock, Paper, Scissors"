// GGEZ
// Quite simple really
// You can also use switch, but I love if so ye

// Because of the corona I couldn't buy myself a guitar pic today
// So I literally cut out a leftover plastic type of container for like chocolate nutella
// But not actually nutella because it's too expensive, and it's in glass
// This is something similar, but in plastic
// So what I did was just full on got out the measuring tool
// And I measured the pic length and then I just fully made my own from the measurements
// Cut the thing to size and then I coated it in some black rubber and 
// Boom, it's done xD
