// Man my week has kinda been terrible xdd
// Dude I face planted into the ground from biking
// That shit hurts XD

// Anyway I hope ama be okay, currently it's been chill on recovery
// The doc's say it's just a few simple like 'scratch' marks from the ground
// I mean it looks gross because there's the blood patching, but I guess just
// like any deep scratch, it goes away as the skin forms under the blood.


// I've been chilling away from any friends, chilling on my own
// Doin some programming and forum making 
// It's fun really
// You know I think I should just end up writing in my own spare time 
// In my very own diary or something, since this is really fun for some reason.


// Yeah, just a tip on whatever you're doing, don't get overconfident XD
// All there has to be is one flat patch on your back tyre, one overused tyre
// And a little bit of rain and luck and you're gone, so watch what you're 
// Doing, keep a better understanding on your limits, and how you ride them.

// It's fun riding fast don't get me wrong, though just watch over the limits
// Brake them if you're confident and sure that everything you're working with
// Is stable and actually has 0 problems xddd
